## 📊 Sample Quality Check

### Example: Rotterdam

**Good GPT-3.5 Output:**
```
whyVisit: [
  "Modern architecture including the iconic Cube Houses",
  "Europe's largest port with fascinating maritime history",
  "Excellent public transport making it easy to explore",
  "Vibrant food scene with diverse international cuisine",
  "World-class museums like Boijmans van Beuningen",
  "Easy day trips to other Dutch cities via train"
]
```

**Bad/AI-Sounding Output:**
```
whyVisit: [
  "Unforgettable experiences await at every turn",
  "Stunning beauty that will take your breath away",
  "Must-see destination for every traveler",
  "Endless opportunities for adventure and discovery",
  "World-class attractions that will amaze you",
  "Perfect blend of culture, history, and excitement"
]
```

**Our prompts prevent the "bad" version** by:
