      introduction: `Experience Lake Louise, one of the world's most photographed lakes and Banff's crown jewel! This stunning glacial lake sits at 1,750m elevation surrounded by towering peaks and the massive Victoria Glacier, creating the iconic turquoise color from glacial rock flour. Tours explore the lakefront trails, Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise (historic luxury hotel), canoeing on the pristine waters, hiking to teahouses (Lake Agnes Tea House and Plain of Six Glaciers), winter ice skating and ice sculptures, and Moraine Lake (equally stunning nearby with Valley of Ten Peaks). Learn about Indigenous history, how glaciers created this landscape, and why the water appears that magical turquoise color. Summer brings wildflowers and hiking; winter transforms it into a frozen wonderland. It's the quintessential Canadian Rockies experience!`,

      introduction: `Experience world-class sport fishing in Cabo San Lucas, the legendary "Marlin Capital of the World"! The waters off Cabo's coast offer incredible fishing year-round with marlin (blue, black, striped), dorado (mahi-mahi), tuna (yellowfin, bluefin), wahoo, and sailfish. Fishing charters depart from Cabo's marina exploring the Pacific, Sea of Cortez, and the famous underwater canyon just minutes offshore where warm and cold currents meet creating nutrient-rich waters attracting fish. Charters range from shared pangas (small boats) to luxury yachts with experienced captains and crews, all equipment, bait, and often catch-and-release practices for marlin conservation. The fishing season peaks May-November for marlin but something bites year-round. It's bucket-list fishing!`,

          question: 'How long is the Las Vegas Strip?',
          answer: '4.2 miles from Mandalay Bay to Stratosphere! Looks shorter than it is. Walking entire Strip takes 2+ hours. Casinos are massive - Venetian alone is over 1 mile walking. Use hop-on buses or trams to save energy!',

          question: 'Are Strip tours worth it?',
          answer: 'Worth it for first-timers! Guides share history, point out free attractions, and navigate efficiently. However, much of Strip is self-exploratory. Consider hop-on-hop-off bus ($50-60) for flexibility. Evening walking tours capture Vegas magic best!',

        'Warner Bros tour most comprehensive - book this if choosing only one!',
        'Studio tours book out weeks ahead - reserve early!',
        'You might see celebrities - but tours emphasize production over star-gazing.',
        'Photography restrictions on all tours - respect rules or get kicked out!',
        'Wear comfortable shoes - lots of walking (1-2 miles).',
        'Each tour differs based on what\'s filming - experiences vary daily.',

      faqs: [
        {
          question: 'Which studio tour is best?',
          answer: 'Warner Bros (#1 - $75, 3 hours, most comprehensive). Paramount ($65, 2 hours, historic Hollywood location). Sony ($55, 2 hours, intimate, budget). Universal (theme park, $100+). Warner Bros shows most behind-scenes. Book it!',
        },
        {
          question: 'Can you see celebrities on studio tours?',
          answer: 'Possible but not guaranteed! You might spot actors during filming breaks or see someone famous across the lot. Tours focus on production, not celebrity sightings. Lower expectations - treat celebrity encounters as bonus. It happens occasionally!',
        },
        {
          question: 'How much do studio tours cost?',
          answer: 'Warner Bros: $75 (3 hours). Paramount: $65 (2 hours). Sony: $55 (2 hours). Universal Studios: $100+ (full day theme park). VIP tours: $300+. Standard tours worth the price - unique access to working studios!',
        },
        {
          question: 'Do you need to book studio tours in advance?',
          answer: 'YES! Tours sell out 2-4 weeks ahead, especially summer and weekends. Warner Bros fills fastest. Book online as soon as dates known. Walk-ups rarely available. Advance booking essential for studio tours!',
        },
        {
          question: 'What is the difference between Warner Bros and Universal?',
          answer: 'Warner Bros: Working studio tour (3 hours, intimate, behind-scenes). Universal Studios: Theme park with studio tour component (full day, tram ride, includes rides). WB for film fans, Universal for families. Both worthwhile but very different!',
        },
        {
          question: 'Can you take photos on studio tours?',
          answer: 'Limited! Photos allowed in certain areas (backlots, some exhibits) but NOT near active filming, inside sound stages with sets, or of confidential material. Guides specify when photos allowed. Violators get kicked out. Respect rules!',
        },
        {
          question: 'Will you see active filming?',
          answer: 'Maybe! Tours visit sound stages and backlots where filming happens. However, production schedules vary daily - some days busy, some quiet. Can\'t guarantee active sets. Guides share what\'s filming but access depends on production needs.',
        },
        {
          question: 'Are studio tours worth it?',
          answer: 'Absolutely for movie fans! Seeing where films are actually made, walking famous backlots, understanding production process - it\'s incredible. Warner Bros especially delivers. $65-75 for 2-3 hours of exclusive access is fair value. Highly recommended!',
