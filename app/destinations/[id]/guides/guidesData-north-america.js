      introduction: `Experience Lake Louise, one of the world's most photographed lakes and Banff's crown jewel! This stunning glacial lake sits at 1,750m elevation surrounded by towering peaks and the massive Victoria Glacier, creating the iconic turquoise color from glacial rock flour. Tours explore the lakefront trails, Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise (historic luxury hotel), canoeing on the pristine waters, hiking to teahouses (Lake Agnes Tea House and Plain of Six Glaciers), winter ice skating and ice sculptures, and Moraine Lake (equally stunning nearby with Valley of Ten Peaks). Learn about Indigenous history, how glaciers created this landscape, and why the water appears that magical turquoise color. Summer brings wildflowers and hiking; winter transforms it into a frozen wonderland. It's the quintessential Canadian Rockies experience!`,

      introduction: `Experience world-class sport fishing in Cabo San Lucas, the legendary "Marlin Capital of the World"! The waters off Cabo's coast offer incredible fishing year-round with marlin (blue, black, striped), dorado (mahi-mahi), tuna (yellowfin, bluefin), wahoo, and sailfish. Fishing charters depart from Cabo's marina exploring the Pacific, Sea of Cortez, and the famous underwater canyon just minutes offshore where warm and cold currents meet creating nutrient-rich waters attracting fish. Charters range from shared pangas (small boats) to luxury yachts with experienced captains and crews, all equipment, bait, and often catch-and-release practices for marlin conservation. The fishing season peaks May-November for marlin but something bites year-round. It's bucket-list fishing!`,

      introduction: `Discover authentic Mexican and Mayan culture beyond Cancun's resort facade! Cultural tours explore traditional Mayan villages where indigenous communities maintain ancestral traditions, participate in temazcal (Mayan sweat lodge ceremonies), learn ancient cooking techniques preparing cochinita pibil and tortillas, visit local markets bursting with produce and spices, and experience Mexican fiestas with mariachi music and folkloric dancing. Tours include Xcaret Park (eco-archaeological park showcasing Mexican culture), Coba's Mayan community, artisan workshops making traditional crafts, cenote ceremonies honoring Mayan water gods, and downtown Cancun neighborhoods where locals live. Learn about Day of the Dead traditions, Mayan cosmology, Mexican history, and the fascinating blend of indigenous and Spanish cultures. It's the real Mexico!`,
