      introduction: `Experience Lake Louise, one of the world's most photographed lakes and Banff's crown jewel! This stunning glacial lake sits at 1,750m elevation surrounded by towering peaks and the massive Victoria Glacier, creating the iconic turquoise color from glacial rock flour. Tours explore the lakefront trails, Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise (historic luxury hotel), canoeing on the pristine waters, hiking to teahouses (Lake Agnes Tea House and Plain of Six Glaciers), winter ice skating and ice sculptures, and Moraine Lake (equally stunning nearby with Valley of Ten Peaks). Learn about Indigenous history, how glaciers created this landscape, and why the water appears that magical turquoise color. Summer brings wildflowers and hiking; winter transforms it into a frozen wonderland. It's the quintessential Canadian Rockies experience!`,

      introduction: `Experience world-class sport fishing in Cabo San Lucas, the legendary "Marlin Capital of the World"! The waters off Cabo's coast offer incredible fishing year-round with marlin (blue, black, striped), dorado (mahi-mahi), tuna (yellowfin, bluefin), wahoo, and sailfish. Fishing charters depart from Cabo's marina exploring the Pacific, Sea of Cortez, and the famous underwater canyon just minutes offshore where warm and cold currents meet creating nutrient-rich waters attracting fish. Charters range from shared pangas (small boats) to luxury yachts with experienced captains and crews, all equipment, bait, and often catch-and-release practices for marlin conservation. The fishing season peaks May-November for marlin but something bites year-round. It's bucket-list fishing!`,

          question: 'How long is the Las Vegas Strip?',
          answer: '4.2 miles from Mandalay Bay to Stratosphere! Looks shorter than it is. Walking entire Strip takes 2+ hours. Casinos are massive - Venetian alone is over 1 mile walking. Use hop-on buses or trams to save energy!',

          question: 'Are Strip tours worth it?',
          answer: 'Worth it for first-timers! Guides share history, point out free attractions, and navigate efficiently. However, much of Strip is self-exploratory. Consider hop-on-hop-off bus ($50-60) for flexibility. Evening walking tours capture Vegas magic best!',

      introduction: `Experience Louisiana's mysterious swamps and bayous - ecosystem unlike anywhere! Swamp tours cruise through cypress forests draped with Spanish moss, see wild alligators (guides sometimes feed them - they jump!), spot herons, egrets, turtles, and diverse wetland wildlife. Tours explore Honey Island Swamp (least altered swamp in Louisiana), Jean Lafitte National Park, Lake Pontchartrain, and bayou communities. Airboat tours offer high-speed thrills while pontoon boats provide relaxed nature viewing. Learn about wetland ecology, Cajun bayou culture, how swamps protect New Orleans from hurricanes, and threats facing Louisiana wetlands (losing football field of land hourly!). It's wild Louisiana!`,

          question: 'How much do Disney World tickets cost?',
          answer: '1-day ticket: $109-159 (varies by season/park). Multi-day better value: 4 days ~$400, 7 days ~$500. Park Hopper add $65/day (visit multiple parks daily). Genie+ $15-25/day extra. Budget $150-200/person/day including food. Annual Pass: $1,400+ if visiting multiple times.',
        },
        {
          question: 'How many days needed for Disney World?',
          answer: 'Minimum 4 days (one per park). Ideal: 5-7 days allowing revisits to favorites and rest. Magic Kingdom alone needs 2 days! Rushing through in 1-2 days = exhausting and missing major attractions. Plan accordingly!',

Animal Kingdom unique (real animals + Avatar). All excellent - depends on interests! Magic Kingdom if choosing one.',

        {
          question: 'Is Disney World worth the money?',
          answer: 'Expensive ($150-200/person/day) but unique experience! Best for families with kids or Disney fans. Not budget destination. However, quality, magic, and memories justify cost for many. Plan ahead to maximize value. Worth it if Disney magic appeals to you!',
        },
        {
          question: 'When is the best time to visit Disney World?',
          answer: 'Best: September-November and January-February (low crowds, mild weather). Avoid: Summer (hot, crowded), Christmas-New Year (insane crowds), spring break. Weekdays less crowded than weekends. Early entry (rope drop) and late closing best times daily!',

        {
          question: 'What is Genie+?',
          answer: 'Genie+ ($15-25/day) skip-the-line system replacing FastPass. Book return times for popular rides via app. Worth it for busy days - saves hours waiting! Lightning Lanes for top rides ($10-20 each separately). Plan to spend $30-50/person for optimal experience.',

        {
          question: 'Should I stay at Disney resort?',
