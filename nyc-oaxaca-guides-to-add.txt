// This file contains the remaining 11 guides to add to guidesData-north-america.js
// 5 NYC guides + 6 Oaxaca guides = 11 total

Due to the file being very large (13,938 lines), I'll add these guides directly by continuing the batch approach.

Let me add them in 2 batches:
1. Remaining 5 NYC guides
2. All 6 Oaxaca guides
