Roasted Caprese & Burrata was ok, no roasted taste, arugula was lukewarm, however Burrata was tasty. We both had the Short Ribs as entrée, kind of misleading since this was served boneless. If you have it as ribs on the menu, i expected a bone-in cut at least. The dessert menu needs to be updated, nothing like what they have on the website. We were presented with 4 choices, the only one that was on the website was the Cookies and Cream. We decided to go for that one, Fried Oreos were tasteful, however they were served with Vanilla ice cream, instead the Dulce de Leche as advertised. DJ music was a nice touch.",

The Vue Bruschetta and Grilled Octopus appetizers were great, and I would recommend the Seafood Eruption and the Vue Apple Pie for dessert.
