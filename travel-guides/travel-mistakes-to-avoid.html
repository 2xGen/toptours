            <p><strong>Even experienced travelers can fall into common traps that make a trip more stressful or expensive than it needs to be.</strong> From overpacking to skipping travel insurance, these small missteps can add up quickly. Here's how to avoid the most frequent travel mistakes and make your next journey as smooth and enjoyable as possible.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Overpacking and Ignoring Airline Restrictions</h2>
            <p>One of the most common travel mistakes is bringing too much. Overpacking not only makes moving around harder but can also lead to overweight baggage fees. Stick to versatile clothing that can be mixed and matched, and check your airline's baggage policy before you fly.</p>
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Pack light and use compression cubes to save space. You'll thank yourself later.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Not Checking Entry Requirements Early</h2>
            <p>Visa requirements, vaccinations, or digital entry forms vary by destination. Waiting until the last minute can lead to delays or even denied boarding. Always check official entry requirements several weeks before your departure.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Forgetting to Buy Travel Insurance</h2>
            <p>Many travelers skip travel insurance to save money—until something goes wrong. Whether it's a canceled flight, lost luggage, or an unexpected illness, insurance provides peace of mind and financial protection.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Ignoring Currency Exchange Fees</h2>
            <p>Using your credit card abroad without understanding exchange fees can lead to costly surprises. Check your bank's international policies or consider a travel-friendly card with low or no foreign transaction fees.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Relying Too Much on a Single Payment Method</h2>
            <p>Always carry a mix of payment options—credit card, debit card, and a small amount of local currency. Some small shops or taxi drivers may only accept cash, especially in rural or island destinations.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Not Researching Local Customs and Etiquette</h2>
            <p>Every culture has its own norms. Failing to research them can lead to uncomfortable situations or even offend locals. Learn a few key phrases and understand basic etiquette before you go.</p>
            
            <h2>7. Planning Too Much in One Day</h2>
            <p>Cramming too many activities into one day can leave you exhausted and unable to enjoy the experience. Build flexibility into your itinerary and allow for downtime to explore freely.</p>
            
            <h2>8. Skipping Advance Bookings for Popular Tours</h2>
            <p>Top-rated activities often sell out weeks in advance—especially during peak seasons. Book your tours ahead of time to secure your spot and lock in better prices.</p>
            
            <h2>9. Ignoring Travel Alerts and Local Safety Advice</h2>
            <p>Before and during your trip, check local safety information and travel advisories. Staying informed about current conditions helps you avoid disruptions and travel smarter.</p>
            
            <h2>10. Not Backing Up Important Documents</h2>
            <p>Losing your passport or travel documents can turn a dream trip into a nightmare. Always keep digital copies stored securely in your email or cloud service, separate from your originals.</p>
